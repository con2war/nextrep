    ### **User Inputs:**
    - **Goal:** ${goal}  
    - **Equipment Available:** ${equipment.length > 0 ? equipment.join(', ') : "Bodyweight Only"}  
    - **Target Muscle Group:** ${muscleGroup.label}  
    - **Time Limit:** ${timeLimit} minutes  
    
    ### **Workout Structure:**
    #### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Warm-up (5-10% of Total Time)**
    - Incorporate **dynamic movements, activation drills, and mobility work** relevant to the target muscle group.
    - Example: **For Leg Day:** Bodyweight Squats, Leg Swings, and Glute Bridges.
    
    #### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Main Workout (80-85% of Total Time)**
    **The structure should follow the user's goal:**
    - **Strength (Strength, Powerlifting):** Heavy compound lifts first, 3-5 reps, 3-5 min rest.
    - **Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth):** 8-12 reps, controlled tempo, 45-90 sec rest.
    - **Endurance & Fat Loss:** Supersets & Circuits, 12-20 reps, short rest (30 sec).
    - **Conditioning/Functional Training:** High-intensity movements, agility drills, explosive exercises.
    
    ${isConditioningWorkout ? `
    ### **For Conditioning Workouts, Use One of These Formats:**
    - **AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)**: 
      - Set a time cap (e.g., 12 minutes).
      - List movements and reps.
      - The goal is to complete as many rounds as possible.
    
    - **For Time**: 
      - Set a fixed number of rounds.
      - List movements and reps.
      - Complete the workout as fast as possible.
    
    - **EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)**: 
      - Set a total duration (e.g., 10 minutes).
      - Assign exercises to each minute.
      - Any remaining time within that minute is rest.
    
    - **TABATA**: 
      - Work for **20 seconds**, rest for **10 seconds**.
      - Complete **8 rounds per movement**.
      - Use multiple movements for variety.
    
    üö® **Ensure the workout style is clearly labeled and instructions are provided for the user.**
    ` : ''}
    
    #### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Cooldown (5-10% of Total Time)**
    - Include **static stretches, mobility drills, and deep breathing techniques** to aid recovery.
    - Example: **For Upper Body:** Shoulder Stretch, Cobra Pose.

    ‚úÖ **Total workout time ‚â§ ${timeLimit} minutes** (structured into warmup, main workout, cooldown).  
    ‚úÖ **Ensure proper movement selection based on available equipment.**  
    ‚úÖ **Prioritize compound movements first, followed by isolation exercises.**  
    ‚úÖ **Match difficulty level & rest times to the user's goal.**  
    ‚úÖ **If no equipment is available, create a bodyweight-only workout.**  
    ‚úÖ **Clearly label conditioning techniques (EMOM, AMRAP, etc.) when used.**  
    ‚úÖ **Return only JSON, no explanations.**
